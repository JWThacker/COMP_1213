## COMP 1213
This course was an introduction to programming, but for me, it was really an introduction on how to write well documented and functioning software as well an introduction to the OOP paradigm.

The official university course description can befound below in italics:

*Introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming from an object-oriented perspective. Emphasis on good software engineering principles and development of the fundamental programming skills in the context of a language that supports the object-oriented paradigm.*

There were 11 modules in this course. All 11 modules had a project associated with the module. Each project can found in each of the corresponding directories (module_1, module_2 etc.).

A brief summary of their content can be found below:

   1. Fundamentals of computing and Java
   2. Data and Expressions
   3. Java Library Classes and Objects
   4. Writing Classes
   5. Cond/Loops: Conditionals and Loops (if and while statements)
   6. Cond/Loops: More Conditionals and Loops (switch, for, for each, do statements)
   7. Two part Module on Object-Oriented design

     * 7A - Object-Oriented Design 1 and JUnit Testing
